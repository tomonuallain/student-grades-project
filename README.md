In my final project for STAT40080 Data Programming in Python at UCD, I analysed data derived from a study on performances of Portuguese students in maths exams. 
Project includes: exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, logistic regression for grade classification, random forest regression for grade prediction and clustering to identify the existence of different student groups.
